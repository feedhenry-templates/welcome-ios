## What is it?

A native iOS template for rapid development using RHMAP. The template uses UI elements like the [Navigation Drawer](), the Action Bar and Fragments.

The [iOS FeedHenry SDK]() is used to:
- perform cloud calls, 
- store data in the cloud using Mongo DB
- use a third party API to get location based weather data. 
 
Push notifications will be in a later release.

If you do not have access to a RHMAP instance, you can sign up for a free instance at [https://openshift.feedhenry.com/](https://openshift.feedhenry.com/).

## How do I run it?  

### RHMAP Studio

This application and its cloud services are available as a project template in RHMAP as part of the "Welcome Project" template.
